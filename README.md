# Masters Degree Project: Gherkin Steps Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a pipeline to classify Gherkin steps into one of three categories:
- **Precondição** (Given)
- **Ação** (When)
- **Resultado** (Then)

 TF-IDF and Word2Vec are combined for feature extraction with several machine learning and deep learning models:
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- BERT Transformer (fine‑tuned)
